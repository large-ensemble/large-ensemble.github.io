We would like to announce Dr. Giovanni Liguori as our first speaker of 2021. Giovanni's research has been largely directed towards understanding the mechanisms responsible for the observed and projected climate variability in the Pacific region, including the role of natural and anthropogenic-forced variability, and interactions between tropics and extratropics.
