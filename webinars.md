**Isolating the Evolving Contributions of Anthropogenic Aerosols and Greenhouse Gases: A New CESM1 Large Ensemble Community Resource**

We are pleased to announce [Dr. Clara Deser](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/cdeser/) as our first speaker in the webinar series. Clara has pioneered the use of large ensembles in the climate modelling community and is a co-chair of the US CLIVAR Working Group on Large Ensembles. In the webinar, she will introduce a new large ensemble of single-forcing experiments and how it can be used to disentangle the contributions from different forcing agents over the historical period.

If you would like to attend the webinar, please register.
