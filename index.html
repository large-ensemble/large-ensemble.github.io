subtitle: SMILE (Single Model Initial-condition Large Ensemble) community website
---

This website is created for and by scientists analysing, designing, and running large ensembles.

The purpose of this website is to provide a landing page for anything SMILE:
- the SMILE webinar series
- conference sessions and workshops
- links to publicly available large ensemble datasets
- the SMILE mailing list 

The idea of the SMILE community is to provide a forum to learn about new applications of large ensembles, exchange ideas and experiences, and possibly even start new collaborations. If you have an idea how we can improve this community forum, feel free to reach out and get involved!
