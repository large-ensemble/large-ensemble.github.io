We are pleased to announce Dr. Laura Suarez-Gutierrez as our next speaker in the webinar series. Laura Suarez-Gutierrez works as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M). Her research focuses on understanding the internal variability of European heat extremes on different timescales. Furthermore, she works on new and better ways of evaluating the forced trends and variability in climate models using SMILEs.

This webinar will be recorded subject to speaker approval.

_Dr. John Fyfe. Senior Research Scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, Victoria BC Canada_

We are pleased to announce Dr. John Fyfe as our next speaker in the webinar series. John is one of the scientists behind the Canadian large ensemble experiments. CCCma has not only produced a large ensemble with their CMIP5 model, but was the first modelling center that uploaded large ensemble simulations for a variety of CMIP6 experiments to ESGF.
